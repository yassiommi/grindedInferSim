## 1. Introduction

Modern LLM inference systems face a fundamental tension between compute throughput and memory bandwidth. During the autoregressive decode phase, each generated token requires loading the entire KV cache accumulated from all prior tokens, creating an I/O bottleneck that grows linearly with context length. This bottleneck manifests differently across model architectures: dense models with Multi-Head Attention (MHA) suffer severely, while sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with compressed attention mechanisms like Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) exhibit qualitatively different performance characteristics.

To study these dynamics at the **per-layer level**, we developed an extended simulation framework that integrates two complementary systems:

- **Vidur** (extended): An event-driven LLM inference simulator with production-grade batch scheduling, pipeline parallelism, and profiling-based execution time prediction. We extended it with layer-level timing, GPU-initiated KV cache prefetching, and first-principles MoE compute modeling.

- **InferSim**: A hardware-aware inference simulator that models operations at the kernel level using FLOPs-based throughput estimation with empirical Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) benchmarks. It provides the analytical backbone for MoE expert timing, communication bandwidth models, and KV cache sizing.

The integrated framework enables us to:
1. Decompose inference latency into per-layer compute, I/O, and communication components
2. Model GPU-initiated KV cache prefetching with three independent hardware streams
3. Quantify the impact of PCIe bandwidth on KV cache transfer times
4. Analyze why sparse MoE models have fundamentally different bottleneck characteristics than dense models

## 2. Framework Architecture

### 2.1 Vidur: Event-Driven LLM Inference Simulator

Vidur organizes inference simulation in a three-level hierarchy:

**Cluster > Replica > Pipeline Stage**

Each **Replica** represents a complete model copy distributed across GPUs. A replica is partitioned into **Pipeline Stages** for pipeline parallelism, and each stage may span multiple GPUs via **Tensor Parallelism** (TP). The simulator uses an event-driven execution model with a priority queue, processing events like batch arrivals, stage completions, and request completions.

**Batch Scheduling (vLLM-style):** Vidur implements the vLLM scheduling algorithm, which greedily fills batches subject to:
- Block-based KV cache memory allocation (with watermark-based preemption)
- Maximum tokens per batch (`max_tokens_in_batch`)
- Batch size cap (`batch_size_cap`)
- Request priority (prefill vs. decode phase separation)

**Execution Time Prediction:** For each batch processed at a pipeline stage, Vidur computes execution times using one of two predictors:
- **SklearnExecutionTimePredictor**: Trains regression models on real GPU kernel profiling data (attention, MLP projections, norms, etc.) indexed by batch size, sequence length, and device type
- **MoEExecutionTimePredictor**: Extends the sklearn predictor with analytical FLOPs-based timing for MoE operations, following InferSim's methodology

**Our Extensions:**
- Per-layer `LayerExecutionTime` data class tracking 7 independent timing components
- Three-stream hardware scheduling (SM, DMA, NCCL) with overlap computation
- GPU-initiated KV cache prefetch simulation
- MoE-aware execution with expert routing, grouped GEMM, and weight loading

### 2.2 InferSim: Hardware-Aware Compute Modeling

InferSim models inference operations at the kernel level using a FLOPs-to-latency approach:

$$\text{Latency} = \frac{\text{GFLOPs}}{\text{GPU\_TFLOPS} \times 1024 \times \text{MFU}}$$

where **MFU** (Model FLOPs Utilization) is the empirically-measured ratio of achieved throughput to peak throughput for each operation type and hardware configuration.

InferSim provides five key modeling components:

| Component | Module | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Attention Layers | `layers/attn.py` | MHA, GQA, MLA timing with separate prefill/decode paths |
| MoE/FFN Layers | `layers/moe.py` | Routed expert grouped GEMM, shared expert dense GEMM, weight loading |
| Communication | `comm/comm.py` | All-reduce (TP), DeepEP dispatch/combine (EP), bandwidth-delay models |
| KV Cache | `kvcache/kvcache.py` | Per-token KV size for MHA/GQA/MLA, memory budgeting |
| MFU Benchmarks | `mfu/mfu.py` | Empirical utilization factors for FlashAttention, DeepGEMM, etc. |

**Hardware Specifications** are encoded per GPU:

| GPU | FP16 TFLOPS | HBM BW (GB/s) | PCIe BW (GB/s) | NVLink BW (GB/s) |
|-----|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| A40 | 150 | 696 | 31.5 (Gen4) | N/A |
| A100 | 312 | 2,039 | 31.5 (Gen4) | 300 (pairwise) |
| H100 | 1,000 | 3,350 | 64 (Gen5) | 450 (NVSwitch) |

### 2.3 Integration: How the Frameworks Connect

The integration follows a **profiling + analytical delta** pattern:

1. **Dense model operations** (attention projections, norms, activations) use Vidur's sklearn-trained predictors on real GPU profiling data
2. **MoE-specific operations** (routing, expert compute, weight loading) use InferSim's FLOPs-based approach with empirical MFU values
3. **KV cache I/O** uses bandwidth-based modeling from both frameworks
4. **Communication** uses InferSim's bandwidth-delay models for NVLink and RDMA

For MoE models lacking direct profiling data (e.g., DeepSeek-V3), the framework falls back to a similar dense model's profiling data (Llama-3-70B) for attention/projection timing, then adds MoE deltas analytically. This avoids requiring expensive profiling runs on every model variant while maintaining accuracy for the compute-heavy expert operations.

## 3. Operation Modeling and Hardware Conditioning

### 3.1 Per-Layer Timing Breakdown

Each transformer layer is decomposed into seven independent timing components, organized by hardware stream:

```
LayerExecutionTime:
  Compute (SM stream):
    - attention_compute_time:  pre_proj + RoPE + decode/prefill + post_proj + KV_save + norm
    - mlp_compute_time:        up_proj + act + down_proj + norm  (dense)
                           OR  routing + expert_compute + norm   (MoE)

  I/O (DMA stream):
    - kv_cache_load_time:      KV cache transfer over PCIe (host -> GPU)
    - weight_load_time:        Expert weights from HBM (MoE only)

  Communication (NCCL stream):
    - tensor_parallel_comm_time:   All-reduce within TP group
    - expert_parallel_comm_time:   Dispatch/combine for EP (MoE)

  Optimization:
    - prefetch_overlap_savings:    Time saved by DMA/SM overlap
```

The total wall-clock time per layer accounts for overlap between streams:

$$T_{\text{layer}} = \max(T_{\text{compute\_end}},\ T_{\text{io\_end}},\ T_{\text{comm\_end}})$$

### 3.2 Three-Stream Hardware Scheduling

The scheduling model reflects real GPU hardware with three independent execution units:

- **SM (Streaming Multiprocessors)**: Runs GEMMs for attention and MLP/expert compute
- **DMA Engine**: Transfers KV cache over PCIe, can operate concurrently with SM
- **NVLink/NIC (NCCL)**: Runs all-reduce communication, serialized after SM compute

![Three-Stream Scheduling](report_figures/fig2_three_stream_scheduling.png)
*Figure 2: Three-stream hardware scheduling. Without prefetch (top), I/O runs sequentially before compute. With prefetch (bottom), the DMA engine loads the next layer's KV cache concurrently with the current layer's compute, saving up to min(compute_time, next_io_time) per layer.*

**Scheduling Rules:**
1. Layer N's compute can start only when both SM and DMA are free
2. DMA prefetch of layer N+1's KV starts simultaneously with layer N's compute
3. NCCL all-reduce starts only after layer N's SM compute finishes
4. MoE weight loading overlaps with expert compute: `moe_time = max(compute, load)`

**Overlap Calculation:**
```
prefetch_savings[N+1] = min(compute_time[N], kv_cache_load_time[N+1])
effective_io_time[N] = max(0, io_time[N] - prefetch_savings[N])
```

### 3.3 KV Cache I/O and PCIe Bandwidth Modeling

KV cache size per token per layer depends on the attention architecture:

| Attention Type | Formula | Example (per token per layer) |
|---------------|---------|------|
| MHA | `2 * num_kv_heads * head_dim * 2B` | Llama-2-7B: 2 * 32 * 128 * 2 = **16,384 B** |
| GQA | `2 * num_kv_heads * head_dim * 2B` | Llama-3-70B: 2 * 8 * 128 * 2 = **4,096 B** |
| MLA | `(kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim) * 2B` | DeepSeek-V3: (512 + 64) * 2 = **1,152 B** |

![KV Cache Size Comparison](report_figures/fig6_kv_cache_size_comparison.png)
*Figure 3: KV cache size per token per layer across attention architectures. MLA achieves a 14.2x reduction vs. MHA, fundamentally changing the IO/compute balance.*

The KV cache load time per layer is computed from PCIe bandwidth:

$$T_{\text{kv\_load}} = \frac{\text{kv\_bytes\_per\_token} \times \text{avg\_kv\_length} \times \text{decode\_batch\_size}}{\text{PCIe\_BW} \times 0.8}$$

where the 0.8 factor accounts for protocol overhead, transaction sizes, and bus contention.

### 3.4 MoE Expert Timing Model

For Mixture-of-Experts layers, the timing follows InferSim's FLOPs-based approach:

![MoE Timing Model](report_figures/fig10_moe_timing_model.png)
*Figure 4: MoE layer timing model. Routed expert compute and weight loading overlap (taking the max), while shared expert computation and EP communication are additive.*

**Router:** Small GEMM with very low MFU (5%) due to small matrix dimensions:
$$T_{\text{router}} = \frac{2 \times N_{\text{tokens}} \times d_{\text{hidden}} \times N_{\text{experts}}}{GPU\_TFLOPS \times 1024 \times 0.05} \times 10^{-9}$$

**Routed Experts:** Grouped GEMM across `num_experts_per_tok` experts, MFU=15%:
$$T_{\text{routed}} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times d_{\text{hidden}} \times d_{\text{expert\_inter}} \times N_{\text{experts\_per\_tok}} \times N_{\text{tokens}}}{GPU\_TFLOPS \times 1024 \times 0.15} \times 10^{-9}$$

**Weight Loading:** Expert parameters loaded from HBM at 80% of peak bandwidth:
$$T_{\text{load}} = \frac{3 \times d_{\text{hidden}} \times d_{\text{expert\_inter}} \times 2B \times N_{\text{local\_experts}}}{\text{HBM\_BW} \times 0.8}$$

**MoE Layer Total:**
$$T_{\text{MoE}} = \max(T_{\text{routed}},\ T_{\text{load}}) + T_{\text{shared}} + T_{\text{EP\_comm}}$$

The `max()` reflects that expert compute and weight loading can overlap on the GPU.

### 3.5 Communication Modeling

Communication times are modeled using bandwidth-delay models conditioned on the interconnect:

| Communication | Interconnect | Formula |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| TP All-Reduce | NVLink (intra-node) | `tensor_size / nvlink_bw` |
| EP Dispatch | NVLink + RDMA (cross-node) | `tokens * hidden * experts_per_tok * 2B / bw` |
| EP Combine | NVLink + RDMA (cross-node) | Same as dispatch |
| PP Communication | NVLink | `activation_size / nvlink_bw` |

## 5. Results: Dense vs. Sparse Architecture

### 5.1 Per-Layer Timing Breakdown

![Layer Breakdown](report_figures/fig3_layer_breakdown_comparison.png)
*Figure 5: Per-layer timing breakdown during decode phase. Llama-2-7B is heavily IO-bound (KV load = 1.58 ms vs. compute = 1.14 ms). DeepSeek-V3 has more balanced timing due to MLA's 14x smaller KV cache, but introduces communication overhead from TP=8.*

**Llama-2-7B (Dense, MHA, TP=1):**
- Attention compute: 0.462 ms/layer
- MLP compute: 0.681 ms/layer
- KV cache load: 1.583 ms/layer (dominant bottleneck)
- TP communication: 0.0 ms (single GPU)
- Prefetch savings: 0.311 ms/layer
- **IO/Compute ratio: 4.94x** (severely IO-bound)

**DeepSeek-V3 (MoE, MLA, TP=8, EP=8):**
- Attention compute: 0.208 ms/layer
- MoE expert compute: 0.494 ms/layer
- KV cache load: 0.320 ms/layer (MLA compression)
- TP communication: 0.307 ms/layer (NVLink all-reduce)
- Prefetch savings: 0.194 ms/layer
- **IO/Compute ratio: 1.47x** (balanced, with IO still slightly dominant)

### 5.2 IO-Boundedness Distribution

![IO-Bound Distribution](report_figures/fig5_io_bound_piechart.png)
*Figure 6: Fraction of decode batches that are IO-bound (KV load > compute). Llama-2-7B is IO-bound in 100% of batches; DeepSeek-V3 in 60.3%.*

**Llama-2-7B:** 100% of all 57,639 decode batches are IO-bound. The median IO/Compute ratio is 4.485x, meaning the KV cache load time is nearly 5x the compute time per layer. This is a direct consequence of MHA producing 16 KB of KV data per token per layer.

**DeepSeek-V3:** 60.3% of 22,096 decode batches are IO-bound, with a median ratio of 1.389x. The remaining 39.7% are compute-bound. This near-balanced regime is characteristic of models using MLA compression (1.15 KB/token/layer) combined with distributed inference overhead.

**Distribution statistics for DeepSeek-V3:**

| Percentile | IO/Compute Ratio |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Median (P50) | 1.389x |
| P90 | 2.393x |
| P95 | 2.907x |
| Max | 3.6x |

The P90-P95 range (2.4-2.9x) represents batches with longer average context lengths, confirming that **context length, not batch size**, drives IO-boundedness.

### 5.3 Request-Level Performance

![Request Metrics](report_figures/fig9_request_metrics.png)
*Figure 7: Request-level performance metrics across models. DeepSeek-V3's higher latency is driven by distributed communication overhead (TP=8 all-reduce per layer x 61 layers), not by IO bottlenecks.*

| Metric | Llama-2-7B | DeepSeek-V3 |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Mean E2E Latency | 337.4 ms | 4,977.0 ms |
| P99 E2E Latency | 368.0 ms | 6,825.4 ms |
| Mean TTFT | 154.0 ms | 254.0 ms |
| Mean TPOT | 0.387 ms | 9.257 ms |
| Requests | 128 | 128 |

DeepSeek-V3's 14.8x higher TPOT (9.26 ms vs. 0.39 ms) is primarily due to:
1. **61 layers vs. 32 layers** (1.9x more layers)
2. **TP=8 all-reduce per layer** (0.307 ms x 2 per layer = 0.614 ms communication overhead)
3. **MoE routing and expert dispatch/combine** overhead
4. The model is 671B parameters distributed across 8 GPUs vs. 7B on a single GPU

### 5.4 Layer Execution Waterfall

![Layer Waterfall](report_figures/fig8_layer_waterfall_deepseek.png)
*Figure 8: Layer execution waterfall for DeepSeek-V3 decode with KV prefetch enabled. The DMA stream (blue) prefetches the next layer's KV cache concurrently with SM compute (green). NCCL communication (orange) runs after compute completes. Red hatching shows overlap savings.*

The waterfall illustrates the three-stream scheduling in action:
- The **SM compute stream** processes attention and MoE expert computation
- The **DMA stream** starts KV prefetch for the next layer simultaneously with compute
- The **NCCL stream** runs all-reduce after compute, before the next layer can begin
- The **critical path** alternates between `max(DMA, NCCL)` determining when the next layer starts

---

## 6. Results: PCIe Generation Impact

### 6.1 KV Cache Load Time Scaling

![PCIe Comparison](report_figures/fig4_pcie_comparison.png)
*Figure 9: Impact of PCIe generation on KV cache I/O. (Left) KV load time nearly doubles from Gen4 to Gen3. (Center) IO/Compute ratio increases proportionally. (Right) Prefetch savings remain nearly constant since they're bounded by compute time.*

Halving the PCIe bandwidth (31.5 -> 16 GB/s) has a direct, near-linear impact on KV load time:

| Model | PCIe Gen4 KV Load | PCIe Gen3 KV Load | Increase |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Llama-2-7B | 1.583 ms | 3.117 ms | **1.97x** |
| DeepSeek-V3 | 0.320 ms | 0.614 ms | **1.92x** |

The ~2x increase matches the theoretical expectation: `load_time = kv_bytes / (PCIe_BW * efficiency)`.

### 6.2 IO/Compute Ratio Shift

| Model | PCIe Gen4 Ratio | PCIe Gen3 Ratio | Shift |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Llama-2-7B | 4.94x | 9.72x | +97% (severely IO-bound in both) |
| DeepSeek-V3 | 1.47x | 2.81x | +91% (shifts from balanced to IO-bound) |

For Llama-2-7B, the model is already severely IO-bound at Gen4 (4.94x), so Gen3 merely worsens an existing bottleneck. For DeepSeek-V3, Gen3 shifts the model from a near-balanced regime (1.47x) to a clearly IO-dominated regime (2.81x), where KV loading becomes the critical path for nearly all decode batches.

### 6.3 Prefetch Savings Are Bounded by Compute

Crucially, prefetch savings remain approximately constant across PCIe generations:

| Model | PCIe Gen4 Savings | PCIe Gen3 Savings |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Llama-2-7B | 0.311 ms/layer | 0.311 ms/layer |
| DeepSeek-V3 | 0.194 ms/layer | 0.205 ms/layer |

This is because prefetch savings are bounded by `min(compute_time, next_kv_load_time)`. Since compute time is constant and always less than KV load time (in the IO-bound regime), the savings are capped at the compute time regardless of PCIe bandwidth. This means:

- **Faster PCIe helps linearly** by reducing the absolute IO time
- **Prefetch helps by a fixed amount** determined by the compute time
- When `IO >> Compute`, prefetch saves a diminishing fraction of the total time

### 6.4 End-to-End Latency Impact

| Model | PCIe Gen4 E2E | PCIe Gen3 E2E | Change |
|-------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Llama-2-7B | 337.4 ms | 337.2 ms | -0.06% (negligible) |
| DeepSeek-V3 | 4,977.0 ms | 4,578.2 ms | -8.0% |

For Llama-2-7B (single GPU), the KV load time does not affect end-to-end latency because the profiled execution times already implicitly include KV loading from real GPU traces. The PCIe-based estimate is used only for the prefetch overlap calculation.

For DeepSeek-V3, the slight reduction at Gen3 is an artifact of scheduler behavior: slower requests lead to different batch compositions, which can occasionally reduce contention.

---

## 7. Results: Batch Size Sweep

### 7.1 Batch Size Does Not Affect IO/Compute Ratio

![Batch Size Sweep](report_figures/fig7_batch_size_vs_context_length.png)
*Figure 10: (Left) IO vs. Compute across batch size caps 16-512: both metrics remain constant. (Right) Analytical model showing KV load time scales with context length, not batch size, for MLA models.*

We swept batch size caps from 16 to 512 for DeepSeek-V3:

| Batch Size Cap | Avg KV Load (ms) | Avg Compute (ms) | IO/Compute Ratio |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 16 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |
| 32 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |
| 64 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |
| 128 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |
| 256 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |
| 512 | 0.2904 | 0.2164 | 1.34x |

The IO/Compute ratio is **constant at 1.34x across all batch sizes**. This is a critical finding.

### 7.2 Why Batch Size Is Not the Bottleneck for Sparse Models

In dense models, increasing batch size increases both compute and IO proportionally (more tokens to attend to, more KV to load). The ratio remains stable. But the absolute times grow, and the system becomes compute-limited when batch GEMM utilization saturates GPU SMs.

For sparse MoE models like DeepSeek-V3, the situation is fundamentally different:

**1. Context length, not batch size, determines KV cache IO:**

The KV cache load time per layer is:
$$T_{\text{kv}} = \frac{kv\_bytes\_per\_token \times avg\_kv\_length \times decode\_bs}{PCIe\_BW \times 0.8}$$

For MLA with `kv_lora_rank=512, qk_rope_head_dim=64`:
- KV bytes/token/layer = (512 + 64) x 2 = **1,152 bytes**

At a fixed context length, doubling batch size doubles both the numerator (more requests) and the total compute (more tokens processed), so the ratio stays constant. The absolute IO time per layer is the same for a batch of 16 requests with 2K context vs. 128 requests with 2K context, because the **per-token KV size is tiny** (1.15 KB).

**2. Expert compute scales sub-linearly with batch size:**

MoE routed expert compute uses grouped GEMM, which has poor utilization (MFU ~15%) regardless of batch size for decode (batch size = 1 token per request). The grouped GEMM kernel processes `num_experts_per_tok` (8) small matrix multiplications per token. Increasing the decode batch size adds more tokens to route, but each token independently activates 8 out of 256 experts. The total FLOPs scale linearly, but the grouped GEMM MFU doesn't improve significantly because the per-expert batch size remains small.

**3. The real bottleneck is context length:**

The right panel of Figure 10 shows how KV load time scales with context length for different batch sizes. At context length 512, the KV load is negligible (~0.03 ms). At context length 16K, it reaches 0.7 ms for a single request, crossing the compute threshold. This demonstrates that **context length is the primary driver of IO-boundedness** in MoE models, not batch size.

**4. Communication overhead is the true scaling bottleneck:**

For DeepSeek-V3 with TP=8, each layer requires two all-reduce operations (after attention and after MLP), contributing 0.614 ms/layer of communication overhead. This is **independent of both batch size and context length**, creating a fixed per-token latency floor that dominates at scale.

### 7.3 Analytical Crossover Point

From the IO crossover analysis, the analytical KV length where IO equals compute for DeepSeek-V3 is approximately **38,480 tokens**. Below this context length, the model is compute-bound in most batches; above it, IO dominates. For our experiments (2K prefill + 512 decode = ~2.5K context on average), the model operates near the boundary, explaining the 60.3% IO-bound observation.

## 8. Discussion and Conclusions

### 8.1 Complete Summary

![Summary Table](report_figures/fig11_summary_table.png)
*Figure 11: Complete experiment summary across all configurations.*

### 8.2 Key Findings

**1. MLA compression fundamentally changes the IO/Compute balance:**
MLA reduces KV cache size by 14.2x compared to MHA (1,152 B vs. 16,384 B per token per layer). This shifts DeepSeek-V3 from being severely IO-bound (like Llama-2-7B at 4.94x ratio) to a near-balanced regime (1.47x ratio), enabling more effective utilization of GPU compute.

**2. PCIe bandwidth has a direct, linear impact on KV cache IO:**
Halving PCIe bandwidth (Gen4 -> Gen3) nearly doubles KV load times for both models. However, the impact on end-to-end latency depends on whether KV loading is on the critical path. For distributed configurations where communication dominates, the effect is muted.

**3. KV prefetch savings are bounded by compute time:**
GPU-initiated prefetching saves `min(compute_time, next_kv_load_time)` per layer. In IO-dominant regimes, this is always the compute time, making prefetch savings constant regardless of PCIe bandwidth. Prefetch is most effective when IO and compute are roughly balanced.

**4. Batch size is not the IO bottleneck for sparse MoE models:**
Unlike dense models where batch size drives memory pressure, MoE models with MLA have such compact KV caches that batch size has negligible effect on the IO/Compute ratio. The true bottleneck is **context length** (which determines total KV bytes to transfer) and **communication overhead** (which scales with TP degree, not batch size).

**5. Communication is the hidden bottleneck at scale:**
For DeepSeek-V3 with TP=8, all-reduce communication contributes 0.307 ms per layer x 2 (attention + MLP) = 0.614 ms, which is comparable to the total compute time (0.702 ms). As models scale to more GPUs, communication overhead becomes the dominant factor, making PCIe and batch size optimizations secondary.

### 8.3 Implications for System Design

- **For dense MHA models**: Invest in PCIe bandwidth (Gen5/Gen6), maximize KV prefetch overlap, and consider offloading KV cache to CXL-attached memory with higher bandwidth
- **For sparse MoE models**: Focus on communication optimization (better all-reduce algorithms, NVSwitch topology), expert placement to minimize cross-node dispatch, and context-length-aware scheduling
- **For mixed workloads**: The framework's per-layer breakdown enables dynamic strategy selection: use prefetch aggressively for IO-bound layers, pipeline communication during compute-bound layers

### 8.4 Framework Availability

The integrated framework is available in two repositories:
- **Vidur (extended)**: Event-driven simulator with layer timing, KV prefetch, and MoE support
- **InferSim**: Hardware-aware compute and bandwidth modeling

Both support configurable hardware specifications, model architectures, and parallelism strategies, enabling exploration of the inference performance design space.
